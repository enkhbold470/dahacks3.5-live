    "DAHacks 3.5 is a one-day coding marathon. Our goal is to see the most innovative, cutting-edge, and creative projects possible, while keeping the hackathon beginner-friendly for all skill levels. Tracks are NOT requiredâ€”any project you build can win the top overall prizes! Specific themes/tracks are NOT revealed yet, but any innovative, cutting-edge, creative projects are acceptable. If you choose to submit your project to a track, you'll also be eligible for track-specific prizes. So whether you follow a track or blaze your own trail, you have a shot at winning!",
